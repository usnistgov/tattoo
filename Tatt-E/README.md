# Tatt-E - Tattoo Recognition Technology - Evaluation

Tatt-E is being initiated by NIST to assess and measure the capability of systems to perform automated image-based tattoo recognition.  The evaluation seeks to assess comparative and absolute accuracy, along with run-time performance on large, operationally realistic datasets. 

**Participation**:  Interested developers and organizations need to follow the instructions detailed in the [Tatt-E Concept, Evaluation Plan, and API document](https://nigos.nist.gov/tatt-e/tatt-e_api.pdf) to participate in the test.  Implementers should conform to this API and submit algorithms to NIST following the schedule published in the test plan/API document.
